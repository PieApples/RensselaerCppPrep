# RensselaerCppPrep
My practice work in continuing to learn C++ for my Data Structures course at RPI.

A lot of the stuff here is either just from scrap one liners to test different things unique to C++, and
the rest is from RPI's C++ practice course, as well rewriting a few programs from my Python course.
